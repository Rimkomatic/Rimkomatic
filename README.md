# 💫 About Me:
I am a versatile MERN developer . My technical expertise extends to the LAMP stack, Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and UI/UX design using Adobe XD.

Need a back-end dev? I’ve got certifications from IBM. Want a dynamic UI? Google’s got my back on that one. And if you think AI is the future, well, I've got that covered too, thanks to the University of Helsinki.

Among my projects, you will find a web search engine developed using PHP and a full-stack dashboard application built with the MERN stack. These projects showcase my ability to create functional and dynamic web applications.

Feel free to explore my work on GitHub and connect with me on LinkedIn. I am always open to discussing new opportunities and collaborations in the tech world.
